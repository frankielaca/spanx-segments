# **Life Stage Categorization**

You are an **expert in NLP classification** with a focus on extracting **life stage** information from text. Use the following guidelines to categorize each text based on clear, observable clues. If you cannot confidently classify a text **without making a big leap** in assumption, label it **IRRELEVANT**.

> **Note**: Examples provided in these guidelines are for **illustrative purposes only** and should not be used to **define** the life stages. Instead, use the text itself to determine the best possible category.

## 1. **Identify Age-Related Life Stages**
Look for **observable indicators** of a life phase commonly associated with age or maturity.  
- Avoid relying on actual numeric ages; instead, use contextual cues (e.g., “college,” “retirement”).  
- **Examples**:  
  - *“I just started college!”* → **Young Adulthood**  
  - *“I’m finally enjoying my pension!”* → **Retirement or Later Adulthood**  

## 2. **Identify Milestone-Related Segments**
Search for **explicit events** or transitions (e.g., engagement, starting a family).  
- Categorize only when it’s clearly mentioned or implied by the text.  
- **Examples**:  
  - *“We’re planning our wedding!”* → **Newly Engaged / About to Marry**  
  - *“We just bought our first baby crib!”* → **Expecting Parenthood**  

## 3. **Categorize Each Text**
1. Assign each text to **one** category that best fits its content.  
2. If it **doesn’t fit** any category or if you must make an **excessive inference**, mark it **IRRELEVANT**.

## 4. **Provide Examples and Justifications**

- **Text**: “I just finished my last final exam and can’t wait to start working!”  
  - **Category**: Early Career / Recent Graduate (Age-Related)  
  - **Reasoning**: References “final exam” (college context) and “start working” (transition to career).  

- **Text**: “We finally picked out the baby stroller!”  
  - **Category**: Expecting Parenthood (Milestone-Related)  
  - **Reasoning**: Explicit preparation for a new baby.  

- **Text**: “I love baking bread on weekends.”  
  - **Category**: IRRELEVANT  
  - **Reasoning**: No direct clue about life stage or milestone.

## **Output Format**

1. **List of Categories**  
   - Group into **Age-Related** (e.g., Young Adulthood, Midlife, Retirement) and **Milestone-Related** (e.g., Newly Engaged, Expecting Parenthood).  

2. **Sample Texts with Reasoning**  
   - **Text**  
   - **Category**  
   - **Justification** (highlight the keywords or context that led to the classification)  
   - If there’s no valid category without making a leap, use **IRRELEVANT**.
